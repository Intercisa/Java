/*
 * Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use the singly linked list or the doubly linked list. 
 *  A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node,
 *  and next is a pointer/reference to the next node. 
 *  If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list.
 *  Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.
 *  Implement these functions in your linked list class:
 *   
 *   get(index) : Get the value of the index-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
 *   
 *   addAtHead(val) : Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. 
 *   After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
 *  
 *   addAtTail(val) : Append a node of value val to the last element of the linked list.
 *   
 *   addAtIndex(index, val) : Add a node of value val before the index-th node in the linked list. 
 *   If index equals to the length of linked list, the node will be appended to the end of linked list. 
 *   If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
 *   
 *   deleteAtIndex(index) : Delete the index-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid.
