 * Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
 * 
 * 
 * Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. 
 * In this case, both input and output will be given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation,
 * as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
 * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. 
 * Therefore, in Example 2 above the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.
