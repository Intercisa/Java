 * Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
 * Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
 * It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of the top k frequent elements is unique.
 * You can return the answer in any order.
