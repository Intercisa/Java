/*
 * Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. 
 * All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.
 * 
 * If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. 
 * For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
 * All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
 * You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
 * One must use all the tickets once and only once.
 * 
 * This is an application of Hierholzer’s algorithm to find a Eulerian path.
