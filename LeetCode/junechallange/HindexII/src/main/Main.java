 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
 * write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 *
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: 
 * "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
 * and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
 * Follow up:
 * This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
 * Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
