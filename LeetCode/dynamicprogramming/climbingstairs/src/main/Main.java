 * You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
 * Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
 * Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
 * 
 * Basically it's a fibonacci.
 * 
 * Base cases:
 * if n <= 0, then the number of ways should be zero.
 * if n == 1, then there is only way to climb the stair.
 * if n == 2, then there are two ways to climb the stairs. 
 * 	One solution is one step by another; the other one is two steps at one time.
