 * Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects, write a function pick which randomly and uniformily
 * picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.
 * Note:
 *   An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates.
 *   A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles.
 *   ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1,y1,x2,y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner,
 *   and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
 *   length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
 *   1 <= rects.length <= 100
 *   pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
 *   pick is called at most 10000 times.
