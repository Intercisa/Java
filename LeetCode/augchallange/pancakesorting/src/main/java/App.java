/*
 * Given an array of integers A, We need to sort the array performing a series of pancake flips.
 * In one pancake flip we do the following steps:
 *   Choose an integer k where 0 <= k < A.length.
 *   Reverse the sub-array A[0...k].
 * For example, if A = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 2, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1],
 * so A = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 2.
 * Return an array of the k-values of the pancake flips that should be performed in order to sort A.
 * Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * A.length flips will be judged as correct.
