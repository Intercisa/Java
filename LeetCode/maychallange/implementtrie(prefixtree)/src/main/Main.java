/*
 * 
 * Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.
 *  a trie, also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search tree—an ordered tree data structure
 *  used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.
 *  the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated; i.e., 
 *  the value of the key is distributed across the structure. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string. 
 *  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie
 * 
 * A trie node should contains the character, its children and the flag that marks if it is a leaf node.
