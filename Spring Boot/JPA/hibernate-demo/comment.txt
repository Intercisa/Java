 If you are using Junit version < 5, so you have to use @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) or @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) etc.
 If you are using Junit version = 5, so you have to use @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) or @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) etc.
 
 
 IMPORTANT about Entity Manager: 
	 as long you are in transaction and you manage something with entityManager 
	 the changes will kept tracked by entityManager as long you are in the transaction   

	 
	 

JPQL Entities <- difference -> SQL Tables
	SELECT c  FROM Course c		-	SELECT * FROM COURSE
